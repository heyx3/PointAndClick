Previous Research
	The “Monkey Island” Series
•	`The Secret of Monkey Island
•	Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
•	The Curse of Monkey Island
•	Escape from Monkey Island
•	Tales of Monkey Island
The Monkey Island series is a is a good example of the visual and mechanical themes that will be incorporated into our game. Not only do the games have a similar point-and-click style that we are trying to emulate, but the artistic style is also similar in that it is pixel based. Our game, however will not only have different and more varied mechanics, but the concept and storyline will be much more edgy, and will seem creepier as opposed to the whimsical nature of Monkey Island.  

One Innovation
	The main innovation that our game has is that it beings new and more modern mechanics to a older and traditionally rigid game type. In the past, point and click story-based games have been fairly similar in mechanics, restricting the player to a select few options and actions. In our game we are going to provide the player more variety in actions and directions to take. The majority of the mechanics that will drive these actions will come from a fully implemented modern cell phone. The cell phone will have a variety of apps and functions that the player will be able to use during the course of the game.
